# Part one
In this assignment, we have to find the coordinate according to normalized coordinate between (-1,-1) and (1,1)   for the first assignment as we can see the page is divided equally so we can assume each part of the grid is 0.1 and the center is (0,0). Now by using the Line command we can draw 8 red lines to match the initial blue lines.

# Part Two
In this part we have to calculate the point of a the circle based on the polunomial approximation we had. *here 128*. after calculating the point using ``` Math.cos()``` and ``` Math.sin()```.
