In this assignment, we have to find the coordinate according to normalized coordinate between (-1,-1) and (1,1)   for the first assignment as we can see the page is divided equally so we can assume each part of the grid is 0.1 and the center is (0,0).  no by using the Line command we can draw 8 red lines to match the initial blue lines.
